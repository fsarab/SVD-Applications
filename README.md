# Singular Value Decomposition

Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a linear algebra technique where a matrix is factored into product of three matrices, that is A = UÎ£VT. Î£ is a diagonal matrix and its entries are called singular values. Interestingly for an image, only the top few singular values contains most of the "information" to represent the image.
